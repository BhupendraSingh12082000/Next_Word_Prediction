# Next Word Prediction Project

## Project Overview

The **Next Word Prediction** project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the next word in a sequence of text. This functionality can be utilized in various applications, including text editors, chatbots, and virtual assistants, to enhance user experience.

## Features

- Predicts the next word based on the given text input.
- Employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
- Can be integrated into applications requiring text prediction capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:
  - TensorFlow/Keras
  - NumPy
  - pandas
  - NLTK or spaCy (for text preprocessing)
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualizations)

## Dataset

The project uses a textual dataset to train and validate the model. Ensure that the dataset:

- Contains diverse and meaningful text.
- Is preprocessed to remove noise, such as special characters and stop words.

## Key Components

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Tokenization**: Splitting the text into individual words.
2. **Cleaning and Normalization**: Converting text to lowercase and removing special characters.
3. **Splitting Data**: Dividing the data into training and testing sets.

### Model Development

- Selection of a recurrent neural network (RNN), such as LSTM or GRU, for sequence prediction.
- Training the model with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.

### Evaluation

- Assessing the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as accuracy or perplexity.

### Deployment

- Integrating the model into an application or service.
